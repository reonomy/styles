# Reonomy Design Styles Library

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@reonomy/styles.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reonomy/styles)

Install:

```bash
$ yarn add @reonomy/styles
```

Usage:

```jsx
import ReonomyStyles from '@reonomy/styles';

function App(){
  return (
    <ReonomyStyles fontDirectory="/fonts">
      <MyApp />
    </ReonomyStyles>
  )
}
```

## What's included
The default export `ReonomyStyles` includes the "kitchen sink" of the Reonomy Web styles library:

- Default Material UI `CssBaseline`

- ReonomyTheme: A custom theme generated by Material UI's `createMuiTheme()`

- ReonomyPalette: A custom palette of all Reonomy colors, known and unknown.

- Global CSS
  - Utilities
    - Helper classes like `.capitalize`, `.uppercase`, `.lowercase` etc, and `.icon-spin` for animated rotating icons.
  - Typography
    - Font references (see below).
  - Labels
    - Colors for Reonomy's user-generated labels `.label-style-1`, `.label-style-2` etc
  - Leader lines
    - Styles for common `dl`/`dt`/`dd` data display

## Typography
Since the Reonomy fonts need to be self-hosted, you will need to supply the ReonomyStyles component with a `fontDirectory` where your fonts are stored, so that the style sheets can access them publicly from the front end.

For example:
```jsx
<ReonomyStyles fontDirectory="/somewhere/public/fonts">
```
will result in the font syle references rendering this css in the app:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Basier Square Regular;
  src: url(/somewhere/public/fonts/basier-square/basiersquare-regular.eot)
  ...
}
```

You must copy a `/basier-square` font folder with the necessary fonts into your site repo. You may copy the [font folder in this repo](https://github.com/reonomy/styles/tree/master/src/fonts/basier-square) to do so. It is stored in this repo only for that convenience.

The library also exposes the above as individual exports in case they are ever needed separately:

- ReonomyPalette: `{}`
- ReonomyCssBaseline: `JSX.Element`
- ReonomyTheme: `Theme`
