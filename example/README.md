# Example Usage of Reonomy Design Styles Library

Uses the most bare-bones (and most likely out-of-date) React App setup possible. Just enough too see a Hello World page property styled using the Reonomy style library.

1. Install dependencies
```bash
$ yarn
```

1. Run Webpack dev server
```bash
$ yarn start
```
