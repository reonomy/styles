# Example Usage of Reonomy Design Styles Library

Uses the most bare-bones (and most likely out-of-date) React App setup possible. Just enough too see a Hello World page property styled using the Reonomy style library.

1. Install dependencies
```bash
$ yarn
```

1. Run Webpack dev server
```bash
$ yarn start
```

1. Reference latest reonomy-styles package
After any updates make sure to bump the version of reonomy-styles in package.json, eg:
```js
"dependencies": {
    "@reonomy/styles": "../reonomy-styles-1.0.5.tgz",
```
